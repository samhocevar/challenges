Fiddling with code challenges such as Advent of Code.

I end up doing most of the exercises in Python. Sometimes I try a language I’m not
very familiar with, such as Go, Rust, or Zig. Sometimes I’m not smart enough to write
a fast Python solution, so I fall back to C++ for the performance. Sometimes I can’t
be bothered to do something elegant and I throw in a nasty Bash one-liner.

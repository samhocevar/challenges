# There is a "wall" of inaccessible full nodes between (30,19) and (37,19)
# The only empty cell is at (35,21)
#  6 moves to get the empty cell to (29,21)
#  21 moves to get the empty cell to (29,0)
#  8 moves to get the empty cell to (37,0)
#
# Now the data is in (36,0) and we need 5 * 36 moves to get it to (0,0)
# using the following steps:
#  # x .    # x #    # x #    # x #    . x #    x . #
#  # # #    # # .    # . #    . # #    # # #    # # #
#
# TODO: There is a way to make it more automatised using path finding, but
# itâ€™ll still rely on assumptions such as the existence of wall nodes.
